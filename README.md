## Program Development:
<p>  </p>

### Conection:
<p> The animation was one of the longest parts of the program, just because I had create a lot of functions just to make it work. The explaining about how it works is quite simple, whenever you press one of the keys that make the character walk(W,A,S,D) and the direction where you pressed to has a walkable space, the game is going to display 4 sequencial images that combined will make the walking animation.</p>

### Bitwise:
<p> The minilibx is the library that we have available to use to make the part usable of the game, the movements and the screen. </p>
