## Mini_talk Project
<p> The mini_talk project is about devoloping a connection between two devices, a server and a client, and create communication between them, in this case, the client must send a message to the server and the server should interpretate it and display the same message in the terminal.</p>


### Main developed areas:
<p> - Understanding and handling of signals;</p>
<p> - Stablishing simple connections;</p>
<p> - Bitwise;</p>


## How to use it:
<p> If you wanna wanna use it, you should clone the repositiory: </p>

<p> After it, you will enter the directory and do: </p>

<p> Then you are going to open 2 terminals, one you will open the server:</p>

<p> The other you will open the client followed by PID, that were display by the server, and the message that you wanna send:</p>


## Program Development:
